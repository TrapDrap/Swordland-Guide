Hello everyone, below will be an overview of the rules regarding our swordland strategy this weekend. 🎁

As we get deeper into Swordland, we need to work together with a strategy in order to win. As you guys probably seen last time, we lost by 360 points, it was a sight we don't want seeing again.

Below I will give a summary of our strategy, please read this even if you think you know how to play, it should be helpful to everybody.

Please read all categories, you will be assigned a main role, but you may need to dynamic switch and adapt between all three roles depending on the situation in the game.

# General Strategy:
Before the battle, make sure to activate Anti-scout (or Counter-recon) in the buffs menu (arrow under your profile at the top right), and optionally, a Troop Capacity Boost, Squad Health, Enemy Attacks Down buff. Lethality is also good for berserkers. F2P or low spenders should only activate the lower tier buff.

During the battle, make sure to pay attention to Map markers set by R4s for our targets, read chat if you have the mental capacity to do so as well. We R4s will be observing structures, but if you believe you need help at a structure, share it in chat!

Below is the priority of structures we are going for the most optimal structures to gain points:
1. Bell Tower first to decrease first occupation time.
2. Stable should be second, to decrease time required to teleport.
3. Sanctums after, they offer the most points per second.
4. Swordshrine after, when it unlocks. Other structures are optional, and we do not need to hold them to win, but if garrisoners have extra troops, you can send them to those structures below 👇 
5. Hall of Reformation, majorly increase our damage and defensive potential. This applies a multiplicative buff to our stats and debuff to the opponent.
6. Abbeys, if possible later in the game. We can't get too greedy about them, it is hard to maintain garrison of everything, avoid teleporting to Abbeys unless it is for gathering dropped crates from garrison switch, or directed by R4s, we want to keep priority to the main point structures that gives us an advantage. Depending on the strength of the opponent, if we don't have enough power to maintain garrison at all times of all above buildings, it may be best to leave Abbeys to them and focus on the above buildings. 

# For all Berserkers:
For the first 20 minutes of the battle, strictly NO full march solo attacks allowed on any castle that are less than 4 TC levels lower from you. For example, if you are TG1, you can attack TC27 maximum, TG3 > TC 29, TC 29 > TC 25, etc.

Once you have locked your target, always attack with only ONE march, your strongest march, with 50/20/30 formation, leave your remaining troops home with your second strongest march to defend your city. Our strategy will be to defend our cities and drain their troops, you get personal points this way as well.

Always scout your enemies before attacking, don't attack if they have too many troops or have too strong heroes home for you to beat. In case an individual you want to attack has Anti-scout activated and you cannot scout them, you can also send ~5000-10000 total suicidal troops with your strongest heroes to get a battle report before attacking with full troops.

If you have any March Skin, you can also bait the enemies you're draining to attack you by sending multiple marches with 1 troop and no heroes, this often makes the enemy think you have no more troops home and will often lead to them attacking with multiple marches on your full city. This strategy works best against enemies less than 2 TC levels above you, and in tandem with your main march.

No solo attacks are permitted on any structure unless you have scouted and are sure you can beat their garrison. Same principle, the garrisoner should be 2+ TC levels below you and have same or lower amount of troops. Launch a rally otherwise, invite those who are at the structure with you to join.

# For Garrison holders:
Rules regarding rally making:
- Only make rallies to structures you are next to, and use your strongest combat heroes.
- Rallies must be at least 2 minutes, or 3 minutes, unless you have multiple people next to you ready to join.
- Always invite those next to you when making a rally. Optionally invite the strongest players too.
- When joining rallies, always make sure you have sped up so your troops can arrive before the rally departs.

Always leave enough troops home to defend, OR leave NO TROOPS home (garrison with all troops). For a good standard, never leave between 1-200k troops home, either zero or more than 200k. If an attacker attacks your city with zero troops, you do not suffer any troops injuries, you only have to extinguish, so if you go without defending your city, be wary at all times and ready to extinguish immediately if attacked.

ALWAYS extinguish if you are garrisoning a building! Send all your troops out if you have someone much stronger harassing your city, either to garrison, reinforce stronger allies, or to join rallies, and just keep extinguishing.

In case of emergency, sending your troops out to occupy tiles near you is also a good way to save them, beware enemies can also attack those tiles. Your garrisoned troops are removed if you get burned to spawn (this is why we, mainly the Berserkers, will burn the opponent. if they don't extinguish in time, they will get sent to spawn). So, stand your ground as long as possible and waste their time, expect to spend a few thousand gems extinguishing throughout the match, especially if you're lower combat stats, and cannot defend your city with remaining troops.

# For Gatherers:
At the start of the game, there will not be anything to gather, wait until our attackers and garrison leads secure structures first and then teleport to already secured structures to help garrison. Send all your troops out to garrison, do not keep any home. Extinguish your fire if you get burnt.

Once mines appear, and you can teleport away, please stay away from structures, and near gathering spots, make sure to send all your marches out to gather, and be ready to teleport.

Be wary of any structure that is held by either the opponent or us for a long time. Crates will drop when the holder switches, between ally and opponent, be sure to teleport immediately to gather any large sums of points when the structure holder switches.

# Other general tips:
- If you are really low on troops, and don't have heal speedups left, you can decide to leave the battle. Leaving the battle heals all of your troops, but you will only be able to rejoin after a 12 minute cooldown. Use this wisely, any time lost is potential points lost for us, hence why we want to avoid troop injuries to stay in battle the longest, it's not a battle of who's strongest, but also who uses their strength sparringly. Obviously do not leave in the last 12-15 minutes, if you are running out of troops during this period of time, switch to Gatherer role instead of either combat roles.
